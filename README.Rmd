## Overview

`{chess}` is an _opinionated_ wrapper for R around
[python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess), an amazing library
created by [Niklas Fiekas](https://github.com/niklasf). It allows users to read
and write [PGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) files as
well as create and explore game trees such as the ones seen in chess books.

## Installation

You can install the most recent version of `{chess}` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/clente/chess) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("clente/chess")
```

This should automatically install python-chess to your `{reticulate}`
environment, but you can also explicitly do it with a convenient function:

``` r
chess::install_chess()
```

## Example

To read an existing game, simply use `read_game()`. To explore it you can use
`forward()`/`back()`, as well as `variations()`/`variation()` to see all
variations listed for the next move and choose one of them.

```{r}
library(chess)

# Read first game from My 60 Memorable Games
file <- system.file("m60mg.pgn", package = "chess")
fischer_sherwin <- read_game(file, n_max = 1)

# Starting position
fischer_sherwin

# Navigate to 4. g3
fischer_sherwin %>%
  forward(7)

# See all variations for 4...
fischer_sherwin %>%
  forward(7) %>%
  variations()

# Follow the sideline
fischer_sherwin %>%
  forward(7) %>%
  variation(2)
```

You can also create your own game with `game()` and add variations to it: the
`move()` function adds moves as well as branches the tree of the game. Strings
are converted to simple moves, while `list()`s behave exactly as parenthesis in
PGN, creating a variation of the last move. Here you can see how to recreate a
[Scholar's mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar%27s_mate) and some ways
to avoid it:

```{r}
# Scholar's mate and some defenses
scholars_mate <- game() %>%
  move("e4") %>%
  move("e5", list("e6"), list("d5")) %>%
  move("Bc4") %>%
  move("Nc6", list("Nf6")) %>%
  move("Qh5") %>%
  move("Nf6", list("g6", "Qf3", "Nf6")) %>%
  move("Qxf7")

# Last mainline move
scholars_mate
```

Note that there are many ways to structure the input to `move()`. See
`vignette("chess")` for more information.

`{chess}` also features many ways of seeing both the game as a whole and the
board at a specific point in time.

```{r}
# Print with unicode (doesn't look good on GitHub)
print(scholars_mate, unicode = TRUE)

# Export the FEN of the board
fen(scholars_mate)

# See the PGN after some move
str(back(scholars_mate, 3))

# Export the PGN after some move
pgn(back(scholars_mate, 3))

# Plot current board
plot(scholars_mate)
```

## Roadmap

- [X] NAGs
- [X] Comments
- [X] Headers
- [X] Start game from FEN
- [X] Better plotting
- [X] More status functions
- [X] Other OSs
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] CRAN
- [ ] Static boards (puzzles)
- [ ] Shiny?
- [ ] Stockfish API?

## Motivation

python-chess served as the inspiration (and backbone) for `{chess}`. While the
original version (and [`{rchess}`](https://github.com/jbkunst/rchess) for that
matter) broadly handles "move generation, move validation" (with powerful
classes and object-oriented syntax), `{chess}` focuses on making it easy to
create and explore PGNs as trees.

By narrowing down the scope of the API, I believe the package becomes more
intuitive to people who just want to quickly create shareable game analyses or
easily explore other people's games without having to resort to point and click
software.

`{chess}`'s first use was helping me study Bobby Fischer's
_My 60 Memorable Games_. After some very difficult [parsing](data-raw/m60mg.R),
I was able to convert the whole book to PGN and
[upload it to lichess](https://lichess.org/study/4zOTO2ki), but I still felt
like the interface was too clumsy...
